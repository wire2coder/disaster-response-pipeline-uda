## Start by running the 
 - "ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb" notebook before moving on to the 
 - "ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb" notebook. 
 
 The former notebook requires two CSV files, "categories.csv" and "messages.csv", while also generating an essential database file called "ETL_Preparation.db" which is required for the latter notebook.

```
 ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb >> ETL_Preparation.db
```

### This folder is for the ETL pipeline. (Extract, Transform, Load), not required for the Python Flask app.
